# Elephant — Manual Memory Commands

Manage the elephant memory system. Local file: `.elephant/memory.md`. Global file: `~/.claude/elephant/memory.md`.

## Entry Format

```
[!!]? YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM : text
```

`[!!]` = important (never compressed). No prefix = routine (eligible for compression after 7 days).

All text caveman-compressed: drop articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically/actually), fragments OK, short synonyms.

## Commands

Parse the args provided to this skill invocation:

### `/elephant save <text>`

Write a routine entry.

1. Get current timestamp: run `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"` via Bash
2. Compress text: drop a/an/the/just/really/basically/actually/simply, max 100 chars
3. Format line: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM : <compressed text>`
4. Prepend to `.elephant/memory.md` (create dir + file if needed)
5. Prepend `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM : <repo> : <compressed text>` to `~/.claude/elephant/memory.md`
6. Confirm: output `saved: <line>`

Repo name = last component of current working directory path.

### `/elephant save !! <text>`

Same as above but prefix line with `[!!] `.

### `/elephant show`

Read `.elephant/memory.md` and print full contents verbatim.

If file missing: print `nothing yet.`

### `/elephant restyle`

Rewrite all entries in `.elephant/memory.md` to strict caveman style. Fixes entries saved without compression.

1. Read `.elephant/memory.md`. If missing: print `nothing yet.` and stop.
2. Parse each line. Each line has the form: `[!!]? YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM : <text>`
   - Lines that don't match this pattern (blank lines, malformed): keep verbatim.
3. For each matched line, apply caveman compression to the `<text>` part only:
   - Strip leading articles: `a `, `an `, `the ` (case-insensitive, at start of text)
   - Remove inline filler words: ` a `, ` an `, ` the `, ` just `, ` really `, ` basically `, ` actually `, ` simply ` (replace with single space)
   - Collapse multiple spaces → single space
   - Trim to 100 chars max (cut at last word boundary before limit)
   - Keep `[!!]` prefix and timestamp unchanged
4. Count how many lines changed.
5. Write restyled content back to `.elephant/memory.md` (use temp file + rename for atomicity).
6. Apply same restyle to `~/.claude/elephant/memory.md`:
   - Only touch lines belonging to this repo (match `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM : <reponame> :` prefix)
   - Same compression rules on the text part (after `<reponame> :`)
7. Report: `restyled N of M entries`

### `/elephant compact`

Compress old routine entries (older than 7 days, no `[!!]` prefix).

1. Read `.elephant/memory.md`
2. Group non-`[!!]` entries older than 7 days by date (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Per day: merge all entries → single line: `YYYY-MM-DD : <entry1 text> + <entry2 text> + ...`
4. Keep `[!!]` entries and entries ≤ 7 days old untouched
5. Write compacted file back (use a temp file + rename for atomicity)
6. Do same for `~/.claude/elephant/memory.md` (filter to this repo's entries only when compacting)
7. Report: `compacted N entries into M lines`

### `/elephant takeover [N]`

Bootstrap memory from git history. Solves cold-start: empty memory → no recall. Seeds backdated entries from real commit history.

Default N = 60 commits. User can pass a number: `/elephant takeover 100`.

Steps:

1. Check if `.elephant/memory.md` exists. If it does and has entries, print warning:
   `⚠ memory already seeded (N entries). re-run to append git history below existing entries.`
   Then continue (don't abort — append git entries below existing).

2. Run: `git log --format="%ci|||%s|||%H" -N` via Bash.
   - `%ci` = ISO 8601 date: `2026-04-12 13:58:23 +0000`
   - `%s` = subject line
   - `%H` = full hash (used only to detect merge commits)

   **If git fails — distinguish two cases:**
   - Run `git rev-parse --git-dir` to check if this is a git repo at all.
     - If that also fails: print `not a git repo. nothing to seed.` and stop.
     - If it succeeds (repo exists but no commits yet): **fall back to session seeding** (see step 2b).

   **If git log returns 0 commits** (empty output, no error): also fall back to session seeding.

   Skip bare upstream sync commits: lines where subject matches `^Merge branch '.+' of https?://` — these are `git pull` noise with no content value.

2b. **Session seeding fallback** (fresh repo — no git history yet):

   The repo is new. Seed from what happened in this session instead.

   1. Get current timestamp via `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`.
   2. Review the current conversation context. Extract 1–5 meaningful events: decisions made, features started, setup done, problems solved. Skip small talk and meta-conversation.
   3. Caveman-compress each event (drop a/an/the/just/really/basically/actually/simply, max 100 chars).
   4. Mark `[!!]` if the event is significant (feature start, key decision, major setup).
   5. Format as normal entries using the current timestamp.
   6. Write to `.elephant/memory.md` and `~/.claude/elephant/memory.md` per steps 5–6.
   7. Report:
      ```
      fresh repo — no git history. seeded N entries from current session.
      tip: run /elephant takeover again after your first commit to append git history
      ```

3. For each remaining commit line, parse:
   - **Timestamp**: take first 16 chars of `%ci` → `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
   - **Subject**: caveman-compress (drop a/an/the/just/really/basically/actually/simply, max 100 chars)
   - **Important?**: mark `[!!]` if subject matches any of:
     - starts with `feat`, `fix`, `breaking`, `release`, `deploy`, `revert`
     - contains `Merge pull request` or `Merge branch`
     - conventional commit with `!` (e.g. `feat!:`, `fix!:`)
     - subject contains `(#` (PR reference = likely significant)

4. Format entries (newest first, matching git log default order):

   ```
   [!!] 2026-04-12 13:58 : feat: elephant memory system
   2026-04-12 12:00 : fix typo in output kit
   ```

5. Write to `.elephant/memory.md`:
   - If file didn't exist: create dir + file, write all entries.
   - If file existed: prepend nothing new to existing entries; instead append git entries BELOW (so existing human entries stay at top).
   - Use a temp file + rename for atomicity.

6. For each entry, also append to `~/.claude/elephant/memory.md` (repo-prefixed):

   ```
   [!!] 2026-04-12 13:58 : tonone : feat: elephant memory system
   ```

   Append only entries not already present (match on timestamp + text).

7. Report:
   ```
   seeded N entries (YYYY-MM-DD → YYYY-MM-DD) — M marked [!!]
   tip: run /elephant compact to merge old routine entries
   ```

### `/elephant update`

Pull latest elephant from GitHub and install it — no manual plugin directory navigation needed.

#### Step 1 — Resolve paths

```bash
MARKETPLACE_DIR="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/elephant"
INSTALLED_JSON="$HOME/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json"
CACHE_BASE="$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/elephant/elephant"
```

Read current installed version:
```bash
jq -r '."elephant@elephant"[0].version' "$INSTALLED_JSON"
```

#### Step 2 — Fetch updates

```bash
git -C "$MARKETPLACE_DIR" fetch --quiet origin main
```

Check if anything changed:
```bash
git -C "$MARKETPLACE_DIR" log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
```

If output is empty: print `already up to date (vX.Y.Z).` and **stop immediately — do not proceed to step 3**.

#### Step 3 — Pull

```bash
git -C "$MARKETPLACE_DIR" pull --quiet origin main
```

Read new version:
```bash
NEW_VERSION=$(jq -r '.plugins[0].version' "$MARKETPLACE_DIR/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json")
```

#### Step 4 — Install to cache

```bash
NEW_CACHE="$CACHE_BASE/$NEW_VERSION"
cp -r "$MARKETPLACE_DIR" "$NEW_CACHE"
```

#### Step 5 — Update installed_plugins.json

Use `jq` to patch `installPath` and `version` for the `elephant@elephant` entry:

```bash
NOW=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z")
jq --arg ver "$NEW_VERSION" \
   --arg path "$NEW_CACHE" \
   --arg now "$NOW" \
   '."elephant@elephant"[0].version = $ver |
    ."elephant@elephant"[0].installPath = $path |
    ."elephant@elephant"[0].lastUpdated = $now' \
   "$INSTALLED_JSON" > "$INSTALLED_JSON.tmp" && mv "$INSTALLED_JSON.tmp" "$INSTALLED_JSON"
```

#### Step 6 — Auto restyle

Run the `/elephant restyle` logic automatically on `.elephant/memory.md` and `~/.claude/elephant/memory.md` — same rules as the restyle command. This keeps memory tidy after every update without requiring a separate command.

#### Step 7 — Report

```
updated elephant: v1.1.0 → v1.2.0
installed: ~/.claude/plugins/cache/elephant/elephant/1.2.0

changes:
  <list of commits from git log output in step 2, caveman-compressed>

restyled N of M memory entries
reload claude code to pick up new version
```

Show commits from step 2 git log — caveman-compress each subject line. If many commits, show max 10 newest.

---

### `/elephant changelog [version]`

Generate or update `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo root. Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format. Entries are written as full, readable sentences — **not** caveman-compressed.

#### Step 1 — Detect current version

Run these in parallel:
- `cat CHANGELOG.md 2>/dev/null | grep -m1 '## \[' | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'`
- `cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep '"version"' | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'`
- `cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | grep '^version' | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'`
- `cat Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null | grep '^version' | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'`
- `cat VERSION 2>/dev/null | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'`
- `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1`

Use the first version found. If none found, current version = `0.0.0` (new project).

If user passed `version` as arg (e.g. `/elephant changelog 2.0.0`), skip version suggestion and use that directly. Still collect and categorize changes (steps 2–3), then jump to step 5.

#### Step 2 — Collect changes since last release

Determine the boundary: last git tag, or (if no tags) last entry date in `CHANGELOG.md`, or all commits.

```bash
# Get last tag
git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null

# Commits since last tag (or all if no tag)
LAST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$LAST_TAG" ]; then
  git log "$LAST_TAG"..HEAD --format="%ci|||%s|||%b" --no-merges
else
  git log --format="%ci|||%s|||%b" --no-merges
fi
```

Also read `.elephant/memory.md` — include `[!!]` entries from the same period as supplementary context (they may contain decisions not in commits).

Skip: merge commits, version-bump-only commits (subject matches `^chore: bump version` or `^v\d`).

#### Step 3 — Categorize changes

Parse each commit subject + body. Assign to Keep a Changelog categories:

| Category | Triggers |
|----------|----------|
| **Added** | `feat:`, `feat(*):`  |
| **Changed** | `refactor:`, `perf:`, `style:` |
| **Fixed** | `fix:`, `fix(*):` |
| **Deprecated** | subject contains `deprecat` |
| **Removed** | `chore:` + subject contains `remov` or `delet`, or `feat!:` with removal |
| **Security** | subject contains `security`, `vuln`, `CVE`, `auth` |
| **Breaking** | `feat!:`, `fix!:`, any `!:`, body contains `BREAKING CHANGE:` |

**Entry format: caveman-compressed but with brief context.**

Rules:
- Caveman compression: drop a/an/the/just/really/basically/actually/simply, fragments OK, short synonyms
- Subject line = core change (what)
- Add `—` then 1 short caveman phrase for context (why/impact) — derive from commit body, PR title, or elephant memory
- Skip context phrase if commit body is empty and subject is already clear
- Max ~120 chars total per entry

Example of good entries:
```
- add `--dry-run` flag to deploy — preview changes without applying
- fix race condition in session hook — double memory writes on fast exit
- remove legacy `v1/auth` endpoint — deprecated since 1.3.0, use `v2/auth`
- refactor takeover command — cleaner fallback when no git history yet
```

#### Step 4 — Suggest version bump

Analyze categorized changes and determine the bump recommendation:

| Situation | Bump | Reasoning |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Any **Breaking** entries | **MAJOR** | Breaking changes require major bump per semver |
| Any **Added** entries (no breaking) | **MINOR** | New features → minor |
| Only Fixed / Changed / Security / Deprecated / Removed | **PATCH** | No new public API → patch |

Compute the three candidate versions from current (e.g. `1.3.2`):
- patch: `1.3.3`
- minor: `1.4.0`
- major: `2.0.0`

Present to user using `AskUserQuestion`:

```
Current version: 1.3.2
Changes collected: 2 features, 3 fixes, 0 breaking

Recommendation: MINOR → 1.4.0
Reason: new features added, no breaking changes

Choose version:
  [1] 1.4.0  (minor) — recommended
  [2] 2.0.0  (major) — for breaking changes
  [3] 1.3.3  (patch) — for fixes-only release
  [4] custom — enter a version manually
  [5] unreleased — add to [Unreleased] section without a version
```

If user picks `[4]`, ask for the version string.
If user picks `[5]`, use `Unreleased` as the heading and skip tag creation.

#### Step 5 — Write CHANGELOG.md

Read existing `CHANGELOG.md` if present. Locate the `## [Unreleased]` section if it exists.

**Format:**

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- add `--dry-run` flag to deploy command — preview changes without applying
- add `AskUserQuestion` tool to elephant skill — enables interactive version bump dialog

### Fixed
- fix race condition in session hook — double memory writes on fast exit
- fix timestamp parsing with non-UTC system clock

### Changed
- refactor takeover command error messages — distinguish "not git repo" from "no commits yet"

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-10
...
```

Rules:
- If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist, create it with the full header + new version section.
- If it exists and has an `## [Unreleased]` section: insert the new versioned section immediately after `## [Unreleased]`. Move any items already in `## [Unreleased]` into the new versioned section.
- If it exists with no `## [Unreleased]`: insert the new versioned section at the top (after the header).
- Omit empty categories (don't write `### Fixed` if there are no fixed entries).
- Use today's date (from `date "+%Y-%m-%d"`).

#### Step 6 — Save elephant memory entry

After writing the changelog, save a `[!!]` entry to `.elephant/memory.md`:

```
[!!] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM : release X.Y.Z — N features, M fixes
```

(caveman-compressed as usual for memory entries)

#### Step 7 — Auto-update README.md version badge

After writing CHANGELOG.md, silently update version references in `README.md` if it exists.

Find all occurrences of the old version string (e.g. `1.3.2`) in README.md and replace with the new version. Common patterns to update:

- `version-X.Y.Z-green` (shields.io badge)
- `v1.3.2` anywhere in the file
- `"version": "1.3.2"` — skip (that's package.json territory)

Use exact string replace — do NOT regenerate the README. Only update version strings.

If README.md not found or no version strings matched: skip silently.

Report `README.md version badge updated: vOLD → vNEW` if changed, nothing if skipped.

#### Step 8 — Report

```text
CHANGELOG.md updated — v1.4.0 (2026-04-16)
  Added:   2 entries
  Fixed:   3 entries
  Changed: 1 entry

README.md version badge updated: v1.3.2 → v1.4.0

Next steps:
  git add CHANGELOG.md README.md && git commit -m "chore: update changelog for v1.4.0"
  git tag v1.4.0
```

Do NOT automatically commit or tag — show the commands and let the user run them.

---

### `/elephant readme`

Generate or update `README.md` for the current repo. Uses git history, elephant memory, and project metadata as source material. Writes human-quality prose — not caveman style.

#### Step 1 — Collect context

Run in parallel:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
git log --format="%s" -30 --no-merges 2>/dev/null
git log --format="%ci|||%s" -1 2>/dev/null
date "+%Y-%m-%d"
```

Also read (all in parallel):
- `package.json` — name, description, version, scripts, main entry
- `pyproject.toml` — name, description, version (Python projects)
- `Cargo.toml` — name, description, version (Rust projects)
- `.elephant/memory.md` — important entries (`[!!]`) for context
- `CHANGELOG.md` — most recent release version + summary
- existing `README.md` — preserve user-written sections

#### Step 2 — Determine mode

**Create mode** (no README.md): generate full README from scratch.

**Update mode** (README.md exists): preserve existing structure. Only regenerate sections marked with elephant update markers OR update specific known fields:
- Version badge (shields.io `version-X.Y.Z`)
- Last updated date
- Any section between `<!-- elephant:start -->` and `<!-- elephant:end -->` markers

If no elephant markers exist in an existing README, ask user via `AskUserQuestion`:

```text
README.md exists but has no elephant markers.

Choose:
  [1] Full regenerate — replace entire README.md (recommended for auto-generated READMEs)
  [2] Add elephant section — insert a new section at the bottom with project overview
  [3] Cancel — leave README.md unchanged
```

#### Step 3 — Determine project type and commands

From collected context, infer:
- **Project type**: CLI tool, library, plugin, web app, API, etc. — from package.json `main`/`bin`, repo name patterns, commit subjects
- **Install method**: npm/pip/cargo/manual — from package.json/pyproject.toml/Cargo.toml
- **Commands/API**: extract from package.json `scripts`, bin entries, commit subjects mentioning commands (e.g. `feat: add /foo command`)
- **Stack**: from dependencies or file patterns

#### Step 4 — Generate README content

Write full README in this structure (omit sections with no data):

```markdown
# [project name]

[1–2 sentence description — what it is and why it exists]

## Install

[install commands based on project type]

## Usage

[commands table or API overview — if discoverable]

## How it works

[brief explanation of architecture or key concept — from memory/commits]

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release history.

## License

[license from package.json/pyproject/Cargo or "MIT" as default]
```

Rules:
- Write full English sentences — no caveman compression (this is user-facing docs)
- Keep it concise: prefer 1 clear sentence over 3 vague ones
- If install method unknown, write `# Install` with a TODO placeholder
- If project has a `docs/` folder, link to it: `See [docs/](docs/) for full documentation.`
- For plugins/extensions: include marketplace/install instructions if pattern is recognizable
- Do NOT include elephant memory raw entries in the README — synthesize them into prose

#### Step 5 — Write README.md

**Create mode**: write the full generated content.

**Update mode (full regenerate)**: overwrite with new content.

**Update mode (add elephant section)**: append to existing README.md:

```markdown

---

<!-- elephant:start -->
## About this project

[generated overview paragraph]

*Auto-maintained by [elephant](https://github.com/tonone-ai/elephant). Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD.*
<!-- elephant:end -->
```

**Update mode (markers exist)**: replace content between `<!-- elephant:start -->` and `<!-- elephant:end -->` only.

#### Step 6 — Save memory

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM : readme updated — [mode: created/regenerated/section added]
```

Routine entry (no `[!!]`).

#### Step 7 — Output

```text
README.md [created/updated] — YYYY-MM-DD

Sections written:
  ✓ Install
  ✓ Usage (3 commands detected)
  ✓ How it works
  ✓ Changelog
  ✗ License (not found — added TODO)

Next step:
  git add README.md && git commit -m "docs: update README.md"
```
